# Haarcascade XML Files
This is a copy of the Haarcascade files from the OpenCV GitHub repo located here: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades

This allows for an easy clone of the XML files rather than pulling down the entire OpenCV GitHub repo.

## NOTE
Some of the classifiers have a special license - please, look into the files for details.
